colemakDE
=========

An adaptation of Colemak for German keyboards.

This is the version of Colemak that I use, optimized for ISO 105-key keyboards.

The main differences versus traditional Colemak are:

The swapping of the y and z keys, as per German convention
The placement of Ã¼mlaut keys near their normal counterparts, instead of all bunched around the right pinky.
The transfer of the < > keys to the upper right pinky instead of lower left pinky.



The two files avaliable are a keyboard file for Mac, and an AutoHotKey remapper, which I use on Windows.
